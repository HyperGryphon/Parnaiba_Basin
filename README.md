# Parnaiba_Basin

This is a project to use luminescence sensitivity from rocks and sediments for automatized identification of geological units using machine learning.

The .csv file includes all luminescence data from the manuscript titled "[Luminescence signals of quartz and feldspar as new methods for stratigraphic discrimination and provenance analysis of siliciclastic successions: The case of the Parna√≠ba Basin (Brazil) of West Gondwana](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bre.12590)".

In the R folder there are some of the scripts. 

In the Python folder there are other scripts based on the classes from Prof. Renato Paes de Almeida. Check his channel on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/GeologiaSedimentar/playlists).
